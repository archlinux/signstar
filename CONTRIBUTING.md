# Contributing

These are the contributing guidelines for the signstar project.

Development takes place in the [signstar] repository.

## Writing code

This project is written in [Rust] and formatted using the nightly [`rustfmt`] version.

All contributions are linted using [`clippy`] and spell checked using [`codespell`].
The dependencies are linted with [`cargo-deny`].
License identifiers and copyright statements are checked using [`reuse`].

Various [`just`] targets are used to run checks and tests.

To aide in development, it is encouraged to install the relevant [git pre-commit] and [git pre-push] hooks:

```shell
just add-hooks
```

## Writing specifications

Specifications for technology of this project are written in markdown documents in the context of a component, that serves as its reference implementation.
The specifications are located in the component's `resources/specification/` directory.

### Specification versioning

A new specification version must be created, if fields of an existing specification are altered (e.g. a field is removed, added or otherwise changed semantically).

By default, given an example specification named `topic` and given only one version of `topic` exists, there would only be a document named `topic.md`.
If the need for version two of `topic` arises, the document is renamed to `topicv1.md`, a new file named `topicv2.md` is used for the new version and a symlink from the generic specification name to the most recent version (here `topic.md -> topicv2.md`) is created.
Versioned specifications additionally must clearly state the specification version number they are addressing in the `NAME` and `DESCRIPTION` section of the document.

New (versions of) specifications must be accompanied by examples and code testing those examples.

The examples and code testing those examples must be kept around for legacy and deprecated specifications to guarantee backwards compatibility.

## Writing commit messages

To ensure compatibility and automatic creation of [semantic versioning] compatible releases the commit message style follows [conventional commits].
Additionally, commits must be signed off and should be signed cryptographically.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All commits for this project must be signed off using [`git commit --signoff`].
When running `just add-hooks` in this repository, `git` is configured to do this automatically going forward.

The semantics of the sign off line are explained in the [Developer's Certificate of Origin].

To check if your commits are correctly signed off locally:

```shell
just check-commits
```

To sign off your last commit, if it is not yet signed off:

```shell
git commit --amend --signoff
```

If you want to fix multiple commits on a feature branch:

```shell
git rebase --signoff main
```


## Creating releases

Releases are created by the developers of this project using [`release-plz`] by running (per package in the workspace):

```shell
just prepare-release <package>
```

Changed files are added in a pull request towards the default branch.

Once the changes are merged to the default branch a tag is created and pushed for the respective package:

```shell
just release <package>
```

The crate is afterwards automatically published on [crates.io] using a pipeline job.
