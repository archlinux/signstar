# Contributing

These are the contributing guidelines for the signstar project.

Development takes place at https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/signstar.

## Writing code

This project is written in [Rust] and formatted using the nightly [`rustfmt`] version.

All contributions are linted using [`clippy`] and spell checked using [`codespell`].
The dependencies are linted with [`cargo-deny`].
License identifiers and copyright statements are checked using [`reuse`].

Various [`just`] targets are used to run checks and tests.

To aide in development, it is encouraged to install the relevant [git pre-commit] and [git pre-push] hooks:

```shell
just add-hooks
```

## Writing commit messages

To ensure compatibility and automatic creation of [semantic versioning] compatible releases the commit message style follows [conventional commits].

## Creating releases

Releases are created by the developers of this project using [`release-plz`] by running (per package in the workspace):

```shell
just prepare-release <package>
```

Changed files are added in a pull request towards the default branch.

Once the changes are merged to the default branch a tag is created and pushed for the respective package:

```shell
just release <package>
```

The crate is afterwards automatically published on https://crates.io using a pipeline job.
